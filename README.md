🎬 Movie Data Analysis using Python
📌 Project Overview
This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of movies using Python. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights into trends, audience preferences, and movie performance based on various attributes such as language, genre, popularity, vote average, and more.

🔍 Objectives : 
-Analyze the distribution of movies based on language
-Identify movies with the highest average votes
-Find out which movies received the most votes overall
-Determine the most popular movies
-Visualize data using graphs for easy interpretation

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
-Python 🐍
-Pandas — for data handling
-Matplotlib & Seaborn — for visualization
-Jupyter Notebook / .py scripts — for analysis

📊 Key Visualizations
1. Language-wise Movie Distribution
2. Top 10 Movies by Average Vote
3. Top 10 Movies by Total Votes
4. Top 10 Most Popular Movies
📈 Insights & Observations
English is the most common language in the dataset.
Some movies with lower total votes have high vote averages, indicating strong niche appeal.
Popularity and vote count don’t always correlate — suggesting marketing or region-specific success.
Visualizations make it easy to identify stand-out movies and audience trends.
